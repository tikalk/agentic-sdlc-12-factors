# XII. Team Capability: Systematize Learning and Improvement

*Build organizational muscle memory by formalizing the sharing of best practices and using a versioned suite of evaluations (Evals) to objectively measure the performance of new prompts, tools, and models.*

- [ ] **Share Learnings:** After completing a complex task, share your workflow, successful prompts, or challenges with the team in the AI Development Guild forum or a similar channel.
- [ ] **Contribute to the "Shared Brain":** Use the /levelup workflow (Stage 4) to formalize learnings from a completed task and contribute them back to the team-ai-directives repository.
- [ ] **Participate in Retrospectives:** Actively participate in team retrospectives focused on AI workflow effectiveness to identify what's working and what can be improved in your shared process.
