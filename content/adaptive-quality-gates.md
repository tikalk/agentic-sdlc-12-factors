# VII. Adaptive Quality Gates: Review Appropriately for Each Workflow

## Statement

Implement continuous **"Micro-Reviews"** for synchronous work and formal **"Macro-Reviews"** for all asynchronous, agent-generated code.

## Explanation

The Quality Gates factor defines how quality assurance must be embedded in both workflow modes through different but equally rigorous processes. It establishes a framework for ensuring consistent code quality whether working in real-time collaboration or reviewing asynchronous submissions.

## Key Components

### Synchronous Quality Gates

#### Real-time Review Process
- Immediate feedback loops
- Interactive corrections
- Pattern recognition
- Learning reinforcement
- Context preservation

#### Quality Checkpoints
- Code correctness
- Style compliance
- Performance impact
- Security considerations
- Architecture alignment
- Test coverage

### Asynchronous Quality Gates

#### Automated Checks
- Linting rules
- Unit tests
- Integration tests
- Security scans
- Performance benchmarks
- Documentation coverage

#### Manual Review Process
- Pull request review
- Architecture assessment
- Security audit
- Performance analysis
- Documentation review

## Implementation Guidelines

### Synchronous Workflows

1. **Interactive Review**
   - Real-time code analysis
   - Immediate feedback
   - Pattern guidance
   - Best practice enforcement
   - Learning opportunities

2. **Quality Metrics**
   - Code quality scores
   - Performance benchmarks
   - Security assessments
   - Test coverage
   - Documentation completeness

3. **Feedback Loops**
   - Instant corrections
   - Pattern recognition
   - Knowledge sharing
   - Improvement tracking
   - Learning collection

### Asynchronous Workflows

1. **Automated Pipeline**
   - CI/CD integration
   - Automated testing
   - Static analysis
   - Security scanning
   - Performance testing

2. **Review Process**
   - Code review checklist
   - Architecture review
   - Security assessment
   - Performance analysis
   - Documentation review

3. **Quality Enforcement**
   - Merge requirements
   - Quality thresholds
   - Review approvals
   - Documentation standards
   - Test coverage minimums

## Best Practices

### Gate Design

1. **Clear Standards**
   - Quality metrics
   - Performance targets
   - Security requirements
   - Coverage thresholds
   - Documentation needs

2. **Efficient Process**
   - Automated where possible
   - Clear responsibilities
   - Quick feedback
   - Learning capture
   - Continuous improvement

3. **Balanced Approach**
   - Risk-based assessment
   - Context-aware review
   - Appropriate depth
   - Efficient workflow
   - Value focus
