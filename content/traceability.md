# IX. Traceability: Linking the 'Why' to the 'How'

*Maintain a clear, linked audit trail from the business request in the issue tracker (the 'why') to the specifications, plans, and code in the repository (the 'how').*

- [ ] **Link the Specification:** Ensure the spec.md file in the repository is linked back to the originating issue tracker ticket. The /specify command should handle this automatically.
- [ ] **Link the Plan:** The tasks generated from the plan.md and synced to the issue tracker (/tasks) create a direct link between the plan and the project management view.
- [ ] **Link the Trace:** After completing a task, link to the relevant structured trace (e.g., IDE chat history or an agent's execution summary in a PR description) in the corresponding issue, capturing the full 'chain of thought'.
