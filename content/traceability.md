# VIII. Traceability: Linking the 'Why' to the 'How'

## Statement

Maintain a clear, automated link from the business intent in the issue tracker (the "why") to the specification and code in the repository (the "how").

## Explanation

The Traceability factor establishes that a clear, automated link must exist between the original business intent captured in an issue tracker and the resulting technical artifacts, including specifications and source code. This ensures that every line of code can be traced back to its purpose, which is critical for maintainability, compliance, and impact analysis.
