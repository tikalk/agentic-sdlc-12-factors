# III. Mission Definition: From Intent to Specification

*Every task begins with a formal statement of intent, which is then translated into an executable specification. This artifact, not an informal chat, becomes the unambiguous source of truth.*

- [ ] **Start with the Mission Brief:** The process begins when you are assigned a task in the issue tracker that contains a Mission Brief (Goal, Constraints, Success Criteria).
- [ ] **Generate the Specification (spec.md):** Your first action is to use the platform's CLI (e.g., /specify) to generate a detailed, version-controlled spec.md file from the Mission Brief.
- [ ] **Link the Artifacts:** Commit the newly created spec.md to the feature branch and post a link to it back in the issue tracker, ensuring traceability from intent to specification.
