# XI. Directives as Code: Version and Share AI Behavior

*Treat all natural language instructions that guide AI behavior—from reusable rules to task-specific specifications—as version-controlled assets.*

- [ ] **Pull Latest Directives:** Before starting a new major feature, pull the latest changes from the team-ai-directives repository to ensure you are using the team's most current standards.
- [ ] **Use Standardized Templates:** Whenever possible, reference a shared directive from the library for common tasks (e.g., @team/examples/v1/testing/pytest_class_based.md).
- [ ] **Contribute Back:** If you develop a highly effective new prompt or a "golden" example, submit it back to the team's shared repository via a pull request using the /levelup process.
