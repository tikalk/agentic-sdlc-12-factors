# V. Dual Execution Loops: Pair Program or Delegate Toil

*Based on the triage from the previous step, master two distinct workflows: real-time synchronous collaboration for complex problems and asynchronous delegation for well-defined tasks.*

- [ ] **Execute [SYNC] Tasks (Pair Programming):** For steps marked [SYNC], use your Agentic IDE to engage in an interactive, real-time collaborative session to solve complex or ambiguous problems.
- [ ] **Execute [ASYNC] Tasks (Automating Toil):** For steps marked [ASYNC], delegate the task to a specialized autonomous agent (e.g., via the MCP Server) to handle well-defined, repetitive work, which will typically result in a Pull Request.
