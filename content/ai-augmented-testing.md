# VIII. AI-Augmented, Risk-Based Testing

*Use AI to make a risk-based testing strategy practical. You define what risks matter; the AI generates the specific, targeted tests needed to validate them.*

- [ ] **Identify Key Risks (Human Strategy):** In the Mission Brief or spec.md, explicitly list the most critical business, security, or performance risks for the task.
- [ ] **Prompt for Targeted Tests (AI Execution):** Command the AI to generate specific tests based on the identified risks. For example: "Write a test that asserts a 403 status when an unauthorized user tries to access this endpoint."
- [ ] **Validate Generated Tests (Human Verification):** Always run the AI-generated tests to confirm they are functionally correct and provide meaningful validation against the specified risks.
