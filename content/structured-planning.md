# IV. Structured Planning: Decompose and Triage Tasks

*Use the committed specification to generate an AI-assisted implementation plan, which you will then review, refine, and strategically triage.*

- [ ] **Generate the Plan (plan.md):** Using the committed spec.md as the primary directive, prompt the AI (e.g., /plan) to generate a detailed, step-by-step technical plan, saved as plan.md.
- [ ] **Review and Triage the Plan:** As the Orchestrator, critically review the plan.md. Refine it and, for each step, perform the crucial skill of triage: tagging it as [SYNC] for interactive work or [ASYNC] for delegation.
- [ ] **Sync Tasks to Issue Tracker:** Sync the final, triaged plan back to the issue tracker (e.g., /tasks), creating a high-level checklist for team visibility.
