# IX. Strategic Tooling: Manage a Federated, Governed Stack

## Statement

Manage a suite of specialized tools through a central gateway to ensure control over cost, security, and model choice.

## Explanation

The Workflow Strategy factor establishes how teams should select, integrate, and manage their AI development tools. It emphasizes the importance of having a unified approach to tool management while supporting both synchronous and asynchronous workflows.

## Key Components
