# X. Strategic Tooling: Manage a Federated, Governed Stack

*Select and integrate a suite of specialized tools (IDEs, agents, gateways) routed through a central system to ensure control over cost, security, and model choice.*

- [ ] **Use the Central API Gateway:** Ensure all AI tools your team uses are configured to route their calls through the central gateway (e.g., LiteLLM server).
- [ ] **Choose the Right Tool for the Role:**
    - [ ] For "AI as a Smart Search": Use a codebase search tool.
    - [ ] For "AI as a Pair Programmer" ([SYNC]): Use your primary Agentic IDE.
    - [ ] For "AI as an Intern for Toil" ([ASYNC]): Use an autonomous agent orchestrated by the MCP Server.
