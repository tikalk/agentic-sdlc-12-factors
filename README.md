# The Twelve-Factor Agentic SDLC

This is a methodology for building software using AI coding agents as integral participants throughout the software development lifecycle. The twelve-factor agentic SDLC is a framework that optimizes the development process for modern AI-assisted software development, emphasizing maintainability, scalability, and effective human-AI collaboration.

## The Twelve Factors

I. [Strategic Mindset](/content/strategic-mindset.md)  
Treat AI as a fast, knowledgeable junior partner that requires clear direction, mentorship, and rigorous review.

II. [Context Scaffolding](/content/context-scaffolding.md)  
Manage all context—code, documentation, and team standards—with the same rigor as a critical software library.

III. [Mission Definition](/content/mission-definition.md)  
Initiate every task with a Mission Brief in the issue tracker to generate a formal, version-controlled specification (spec.md).

IV. [Structured Planning](/content/structured-planning.md)  
Use the specification to generate an AI-assisted implementation plan (plan.md), which the developer reviews, refines, and triages.

V. [Dual Execution Loops](/content/dual-execution-loops.md)  
Master two distinct workflows: real-time synchronous collaboration for complex problems and asynchronous delegation for well-defined tasks.

VI. [The Great Filter](/content/great-filter.md)  
The human developer is the ultimate arbiter of quality, filtering all AI output for correctness, architectural cohesion, security, and taste.

VII. [Adaptive Quality Gates](/content/adaptive-quality-gates.md)  
Implement continuous **"Micro-Reviews"** for synchronous work and formal **"Macro-Reviews"** for all asynchronous, agent-generated code.

VIII. [AI-Augmented, Risk-Based Testing](/content/ai-augmented-testing.md)  
The developer defines the business and security risks; the AI generates the specific, targeted tests required to validate them.

IX. [Traceability](/content/traceability.md)  
Maintain a clear, automated link from the business intent in the issue tracker (the "why") to the specification and code in the repository (the "how").

X. [Strategic Tooling](/content/strategic-tooling.md)  
Manage a suite of specialized tools through a central gateway to ensure control over cost, security, and model choice.

XI. [Directives as Code](/content/directives-as-code.md)  
Treat all natural language instructions—from reusable rules and examples to task-specific specifications (spec.md)—as version-controlled assets.

XII. [Team Capability](/content/team-capability.md)  
Build organizational muscle memory by formalizing the sharing of best practices and using a versioned suite of evaluations (Evals) to objectively measure performance.

## Background

The Twelve-Factor Agentic SDLC methodology synthesizes best practices for integrating AI coding agents into the software development lifecycle. It was extracted from real-world experiences of teams successfully adopting and scaling AI-assisted development practices.
