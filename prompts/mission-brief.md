I need to create a new Mission Brief in our issue tracker for the objective: "{YOUR_OBJECTIVE}".
- Propose a one-sentence **Goal**, measurable **Success Criteria** and define the key **Constraints**.
- Using @web, research best practices for this task.
Help me choose the best components from our team's library for the Context Packet.
- Using `@team`, search `/context_modules/personas/v1/` and suggest the most appropriate persona.
- Using `@team`, search `/context_modules/rules/v1/` for relevant style guides and security rules.
- Using `@team`, search `/context_modules/exemplars/v1/` for a high-quality example related to my objective.
