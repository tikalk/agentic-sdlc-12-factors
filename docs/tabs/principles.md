# The Core Principles


## The Twelve Core Principles of Agentic Development.

The Twelve-Factor Agentic SDLC is organized into four core pillars that guide the methodology. This structure translates a strategic mindset into a practical workflow, governed by clear quality controls, and powered by a system for continuous team improvement.

**Pillar I: Strategy**



* **I. Strategic Mindset: Developer as Orchestrator, AI as Intern:** Treat AI as a fast, knowledgeable junior partner that requires clear direction, mentorship, and rigorous review.
* **II. Context Scaffolding: Treat Context as a Dependency:** Manage all context—code, documentation, and team standards—with the same rigor as a critical software library.

**Pillar II: Workflow**



* **III. Mission Definition: From Intent to Specification:** Initiate every task with a formal Mission Brief that is then translated into a detailed, version-controlled Specification. This artifact becomes the unambiguous source of truth for development.
* **IV. Structured Planning: Decompose and Triage Tasks:** Use the Specification to generate an AI-assisted Implementation Plan, which the developer reviews, refines, and triages into interactive and delegated tasks.
* **V. Dual Execution Loops: Pair Program or Delegate Toil:** Master two distinct workflows: real-time synchronous collaboration for complex problems and asynchronous delegation for well-defined tasks.

**Pillar III: Governance**



* **VI. The Great Filter: Apply Irreplaceable Human Judgment:** The developer is the ultimate arbiter of quality, filtering all AI output for correctness, architectural cohesion, security, and taste. Accountability is not transferable.
* **VII. Adaptive Quality Gates: Review Appropriately for Each Workflow:** Implement continuous "Micro-Reviews" for synchronous work and formal "Macro-Reviews" (e.g., Pull Requests, CI pipelines) for all asynchronous, agent-generated code.
* **VIII. AI-Augmented, Risk-Based Testing:** The developer defines the business and security risks; the AI generates the specific, targeted tests required to validate them.

**Pillar IV: Team Capability**



* **IX. Traceability: Linking the 'Why' to the 'How':** Maintain a clear, automated link from the business intent in the issue tracker (the "why") to the specification, plans, and code in the repository (the "how").
* **X. Strategic Tooling: Manage a Federated, Governed Stack:** Select and integrate a suite of specialized tools through a central gateway to ensure control over cost, security, and model choice.
* **XI. Directives as Code: Version and Share AI Behavior:** Treat all natural language instructions—from reusable rules and examples to task-specific specifications—as version-controlled assets.
* **XII. Team Capability: Systematize Learning and Improvement:** Build organizational muscle memory by formalizing the sharing of best practices and using a versioned suite of evaluations to objectively measure performance.
